The band's third album, Crazy World, was released in 2012 and marked a departure from their previous pop rock sound. The album incorporated more acoustic elements, folk influences, and organic instrumentation. The album's lead single, "Be Your Everything", was a romantic ballad that showcased Johnson's vocal range and emotion. The album also featured songs such as "Life of the Party", "The First Time", and "Stuck in the Middle". The album received mixed reviews from critics and fans, who praised the band's experimentation but also missed their signature sound.
 
The band went on hiatus after the release of Crazy World and pursued solo projects. Johnson released a solo EP called The Night Game in 2017 and collaborated with artists such as Avicii, Jason Derulo, and Elle King. DiGiovanni formed a duo called Early Morning Rebel with Nathan James and released an EP called Life Boat in 2013. Dorr joined a band called Best of Friends and released an EP called Best of Friends in 2014. Keefe worked as a drummer for various artists such as Jesse McCartney, Hot Chelle Rae, and MKTO.
 
In 2019, the band announced their reunion and performed at several festivals and venues across the US. They also released a new single called "Tattoo" in 2020, which was a nostalgic tribute to their fans and their journey as a band. The band is currently working on their fifth studio album, which is expected to be released in 2022.
 
Boys Like Girls is one of the most successful pop rock bands of the 2000s and has sold over 1.5 million albums worldwide. They have also won several awards and nominations, such as the MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist in 2008, the Teen Choice Award for Choice Music: Breakout Group in 2009, and the Kerrang!
